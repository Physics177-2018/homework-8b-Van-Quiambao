    "\n",
    "Simulate the 2D Ising model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nSide = 20`, the number of nodes per side\n",
    "* `nTemp = 100`, the number of temperature samples\n",
    "* `Tmin = 1`, `Tmax = 4`, the mininum and maximum temperatures to scan\n",
    "* `nStep = 10000`, the number of Monte Carlo steps to sample the microstates\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should structure your program as follows:**  \n",
    "* Define a variable `state` that is a `nSide` by `nSide` numpy array. Here's a good way to initialize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "state = 2*np.random.randint(2, size=(nSide,nSide))-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a function `mcmc(state, ii, jj, T)` that takes in a state, two indices (between `0` and `nSide-1`), and a temperature and outputs the state after one Markov Chain step.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* The Markov Chain step should be as follows: look at the spin at position (`ii`, `jj`). Propose a step: flip the spin: `spin *= -1`. If that step is energetically favorable, do it. If not, roll the dice relative to $P = e^{-\\Delta E/T}$. Note that `deltaE = 2*spin*Heff`, where the effective magnetic field is simply the sum of nearest neighbor spins.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* What about boundary states? To simplify our lives, impose periodic boundary conditions. Thus the \"neighbor to the right\" of `state[ii,jj]` is `state[(ii+1)%nSide, jj]`.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Define a function `magnetization(state)` that takes in a state and outputs the sum of spins over all sites. The `np.sum` function may be useful.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Define a function `plotState(state)` that plots the spins. Here's a nice definition that you can use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plotState(state):\n",
    "    N = np.shape(state)[0]\n",
    "    xs, ys = np.meshgrid(range(N), range(N))\n",

    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* To run the program: equilibrate the system at `Tmin`. This means running the Markov Chain step over and over again (*without* taking data) to make sure that the system settles to a low energy state. In other words, when you start sampling, you want to sample a \"typical\" microstate at `Tmin`, not an \"unusually energetic\" state. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Now scan over the `nTemp` temperature steps between `Tmin` and `Tmax`. For each temperature, run the Markov Chain to generate `nStep` microstate samples at that temperature. For each microstate, record the magnetization. Take the *average* magnetization at that temperature and record it in an array. (You'll want to also divide by `nStep**2` so that you get the average magnetization *per site*.) I called this array `mags`, you can call it something else.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* You can use the `timeit` package to time how long it takes to run the cell. With the default parameters above, it should take about a minute. You should, of course, be testing with much smaller numbers while you're writing your code. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Plot `mags` (the magnetization per site) as a function of temperature. You should observe a curve (perhaps a little sloppy looking) that looks like the one we sketched in <a href=\"https://github.com/Physics177-2018/Lecture_15\">Lecture 15</a>. If your plot does not look like that, then play with the parameters. Did you equilibrate enough? (I found that I had to equilibrate for `3*nStep` = 30,000 steps to go from a random lattice to a lattice thermalized at `Tmin = 1`. \n",
